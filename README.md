# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Tourism 🌍✈️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global tourism data to
analyze tourism patterns, trends, and country-wise comparisons over multiple years.

The objective is to understand tourism dependency, income-level differences, and
long-term trends using statistical analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze global tourism trends over time
- Compare tourism indicators across countries
- Study tourism dependency of different nations
- Compare high-income and low-income countries
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
- Country-wise tourism data collected over multiple years
- Key indicators include:
  - International tourism arrivals
  - Tourism receipts
  - Income classification of countries
  - Time-series observations

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
The following steps were performed during data preprocessing:

- Handling missing values
- Removing countries with missing data across all years
- Data type verification and correction
- Index handling after interpolation
- Scaling numerical columns
- Detrending time-series data

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Grouping and aggregation by country and income level
- Identification of high and low tourism-dependent countries
- Calculation of tourism dependency and budget-friendliness indicators
- Comparative analysis across different country groups

---

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis
- Line plots for trend analysis
- Comparative visualizations between countries
- Group-wise analysis using aggregated metrics
- Visualization of long-term tourism growth patterns

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
